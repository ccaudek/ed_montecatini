# Questionnaires data

Save a single RDS file obtained with:

1. combining multiple questionnaires Excel files into a single RDS file;
2. cleaning participants identifiers, removing duplicate administrations of the questionnaires, and removing participants with wrong identifiers;
3. adding demographic information;
4. adding diagnostic categories for patients.

Notes:

- CLEAN the identifiers immediately after creating a single file with all the questionnaries data;
- KEEP all the patients information in an Excel file: patients identifiers, diagnostic categories, any other useful information.

TODO:

- FLAG participants with careless responding.
