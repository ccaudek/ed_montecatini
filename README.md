# Eating disorders project

Eating disorders project using data from the Montecatini Frida's center and student controls.

Question: for AN patients, are the deficits in associative learning domain-specific?

This is the version of the project I'm currently working on.

## Tasks

Both patients and controls completed the followint tasks:

- **Questionnaires** -- ?
- **PRL task** Two blocks of ? trial with either food and netural images. Reversals every ? trials. Feedback with ?
- **Task-switching experiment** One block of 120 trials. The first 40 trials they were asked to judge classify a food image (hyper-caloric vs ipo-caloric food); in the second block they were asked to classify flower/leaves; in the third block they  were asked to perform both classification successively, with switch every three trials. On each trial, two images were presented side by side in one of 4 positions on the screen (top/bottom, left/right). One was a food image (hyper- vs ipo-caloric); the other was either a leave or a flower. In the first 80 trials, the position of the two images was irrelevant.  In the last 40 trials it signalled the type of task. In the upper quadrant: Judge the food image; in the lower quadrant: Judge the plant image.
- **Raven's Progressive Matrices** Which version? 
- **WCST**  Trials ?

## Purpose

Establish whether

- RL is compromised in AN patients relative to controls;
- RL deficits are domain-specific (food vs neutral images);
- domain-specific deficits in RL can provide a stronger marker of the disorder than task-switching deficits.
     - Task-switching requires a form of cognitive control in which the rule is explicit and the action/rewards contingencies are deterministic.
     - PRL requires a form of cognitive control in which the rule is implicit and changes over time in an impredictable manner, and the action/rewards contingencies are probabilistic.
